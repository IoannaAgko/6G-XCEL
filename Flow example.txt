- The assigned AI Control App 1 executes the task.
- Retrieves an AI model from the Model Repository.
- Checks the Policy Supervisor to fetch applicable policies and constraints.
- Then is sent to Testing/Validation Component for validation and the validation result is returned to the AI Control App.
- The validated request is send to the Local Node Message Broker, ready for further execution in the network.
